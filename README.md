# Number Guessing Game

## Description

This is a simple command-line number guessing game implemented in Python. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player is challenged to guess it. The program provides feedback if the guess is too high or too low, and continues to prompt the user until they guess the correct number. After guessing correctly, the program displays the number of attempts it took to win the game.
